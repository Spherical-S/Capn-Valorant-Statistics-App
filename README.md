# CAPN - Valorant Statistics App
Version: 1.1.1

CAPN - Valorant Statistics is an application designed to help valorant players find out cool statistics easily. All you have to do is download the app, launch it, and get whatever data you need!

# Safety
* Windows may detect Capn as a virus, this is a **false positive**. Here is a link to a virus scan done for v1.1.0: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/6db3213ac33e64b24dc32b54406878c8bb8226691f50b70e4247fa1eb30130ed?nocache=1
* If windows says it protected your PC, you may still run capn/the capn installer by clicking on "More info" then "run anyways"
* You must run Capn with **administrator priveliges** or it may not work!
* All sensitive data is encrypted and stored on your local machine. It is your job to keep that information safe!

# Current stats available include:
  * Rank - Find out any players rank with just their name and tag

# Credits and support

Thanks to the Valorant App Developers discord server for some help, would not be possible without that community. Special credits to techchrism on github for documenting the riot api, Henrikdev for their valorant api and Officer for their valorant api as well!


I am a begginer python programmer with little expirience with creating UI's so it is not super polished, but I will continue to update the app to the users standards! That being said, if you have a suggestion or found a bug/glitch, please contact me on discord (tiddybite#6304)
